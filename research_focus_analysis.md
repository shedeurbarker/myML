# Research Focus: Recombination-Efficiency Relationship in Perovskite Solar Cells

## Core Research Question

"How do interfacial recombination losses determine the efficiency of perovskite solar cells?"

## Current vs. Ideal Approach

### Current Approach (Efficiency-First)

-   Goal: Maximize efficiency
-   Method: Optimize device parameters for best efficiency
-   Focus: Finding optimal configurations

### Ideal Approach (Recombination-First)

-   Goal: Understand recombination-efficiency relationship
-   Method: Predict recombination rates and their impact on efficiency
-   Focus: Understanding the physics behind efficiency limitations

## Proposed ML Strategy

### 1. Recombination Prediction Models

**Primary Models:**

-   Predict `IntSRHn_mean` (electron recombination) from device parameters
-   Predict `IntSRHp_mean` (hole recombination) from device parameters
-   Predict `IntSRH_total` (total recombination) from device parameters

**Secondary Models:**

-   Predict recombination spatial distribution
-   Predict recombination vs. voltage relationships

### 2. Recombination-Efficiency Relationship Models

**Correlation Analysis:**

-   How does recombination rate correlate with efficiency?
-   What recombination rates correspond to different efficiency ranges?
-   Are there optimal recombination "windows" for best efficiency?

### 3. Physics-Based Insights

**Key Questions:**

-   Which device parameters most strongly affect recombination?
-   What recombination mechanisms dominate at different efficiency levels?
-   How do layer interfaces contribute to recombination losses?

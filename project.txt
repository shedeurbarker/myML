1.5	Research Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable 
of predicting both the quantitative magnitude of Interfacial SRH recombination losses 
at the critical interfaces within the device stack and the overall efficiency of these 
devices. The goal is to go beyond simply classifying dominant loss mechanisms to precise, 
continuous predictions of loss values and their relationship with device performance. By 
understanding the interplay between interfacial SRH recombination and overall device efficiency, 
the model aims to identify the optional balance of device parameters and material
 configurations that yield the highest possible efficiency, considering key 
 contributing factors.

1.6	Method Employed
This project addresses a regression problem by predicting continuous numerical values 
for the SRH recombination rate and the overall efficiency of PSCs. The development of
 a robust and generalized machine learning model requires a large dataset, which is
  primarily generated through computational simulations using open-source software, 
  SIMSalabim. For this regression task, three machine learning models are trained 
  and compared:
	Random Forest Regressor
	 Gradient Boosting Regressor and
	Linear Regression
This models are well-suited for predicting continuous material properties and device 
performance (Valerio et al., 2017).

1.7	Scope of Work
The scope of this work involves the systemic generation of a comprehensive dataset
 through computational simulations, focusing on parameters know to influence 
 interface SRH recombination. The device stack under investigation comprises 
 PCBM (Electron Transport Layer – ETL), Methylammonium lead iodide (CH_3 NH_3 PbI_3) 
 as the active perovskite layer (MAPI) and PEDOT:PSS 
 (Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) as the Hole Transport 
 layer – HTL. Parameters of these specific materials are systematically varied to 
 generate the dataset for the machine learning models. This dataset is then used to
  train and validate three distinct machine learning models: random Forest, Gradient
   Boosting, and Linear Regression. The primary objective is to predict the interfacial SRH 
   recombination rate and the overall efficiency of the PSCs, and to identify the optional
    balance of device parameters and material configurations that yield the highest possible 
    efficiency. The project includes hyperparameter optimization and detail feature importance
     analysis, leveraging Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and Random Forest algorithm to
      investigate the influence of features on target variables.
